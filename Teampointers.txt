Our team has been instrumental in delivering critical automations and enhancements that strengthen operational resilience, deployment efficiency, and self-service capabilities, including AWS, OCF, and EKS rollback enablement, OCF restart/restage self-service, and CyberArk automation, while also driving initiatives such as TEP migration of EKS applications from HSP to TEP, OSV migration, and transitioning request intake from MS Teams to JIRA. In addition to these strategic efforts, we provide troubleshooting support, maintain well-established deployment and pipeline creation with reusable templates for application teams, and operate under a shift rotation model to ensure consistent delivery and an optimized team structure. Given these commitments and the need to sustain service quality, operational stability, and future enhancements, maintaining the current headcount is essential to support ongoing strategic work, provide flexibility to manage critical priorities, and ensure uninterrupted operations until key transformation milestones are successfully achieved.
