Our team has been instrumental in implementing critical automation and enhancement initiatives that significantly improve operational resilience, deployment efficiency, and self-service capabilities for application teams. Key achievements include enabling AWS rollback for AWS templates, OCF rollback for OCF templates, and EKS rollback for EKS templates, ensuring rapid recovery and minimizing downtime in production environments. Additionally, we have delivered OCF restart/restage self-service automation, empowering teams to resolve issues without manual intervention, and implemented CyberArk automation to strengthen security and compliance.

These capabilities directly reduce incident resolution time, enhance system stability, and improve delivery speed for dependent teams. Alongside these, we are actively engaged in strategic initiatives including TEP migration of EKS applications from HSP to TEP, transitioning our request intake process from MS Teams to JIRA, and OSV migration. Given our role in building, supporting, and maintaining these automations—while driving these ongoing initiatives—retaining the current team strength is essential to sustain service quality, manage future enhancements, and ensure uninterrupted support.
